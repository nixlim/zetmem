# ZetMem Conversation Handover - Prompts System Focus

## **CONVERSATION CONTEXT**
User is investigating the ZetMem prompts system after completing comprehensive A-MEM to ZetMem rebranding project. They specifically asked about how `Prompts PromptsConfig \`yaml:"prompts"\`` is used in the codebase and discovered the system is fully implemented but completely unused.

## **KEY DISCOVERY**
The ZetMem project contains a sophisticated, production-ready prompt management system that is **completely unused**:

### **What Exists**
- **Complete PromptManager service** in `pkg/services/prompts.go` (284 lines)
- **3 prompt template files** in `/prompts/` directory
- **Full configuration system** with environment variables
- **Template rendering, caching, hot reload** capabilities
- **Thread-safe operations** with proper Go patterns

### **What's Missing**
- **No actual usage** - PromptManager created but discarded with `_` in main.go
- **No integration** with MCP tools, memory system, or LLM service
- **No connection** to memory evolution despite having `memory_evolution.yaml` prompt

## **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Configuration**
```go
Prompts PromptsConfig `yaml:"prompts"`
// Environment variables: ZETMEM_PROMPTS_PATH, ZETMEM_PROMPTS_CACHE_ENABLED, ZETMEM_PROMPTS_HOT_RELOAD
```

### **Current Implementation Status**
```go
// In cmd/server/main.go line 84 - Creates but immediately discards
_ = services.NewPromptManager(cfg.Prompts, logger.Named("prompts"))
```

### **Available Prompt Templates**
1. `memory_evolution.yaml` - For AI-driven memory network analysis
2. `note_construction.yaml` - For note formatting
3. `enhanced_note_construction.yaml` - Enhanced note templates

## **INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES**

### **High Value**
- **Memory Evolution**: Use `memory_evolution.yaml` for structured AI analysis
- **LLM Service**: Centralize all AI prompts through template system

### **Medium Value**
- **MCP Tools**: Dynamic prompt generation for tool responses
- **Note Construction**: Template-based memory formatting

## **DECISION NEEDED**
User needs to decide whether to:
1. **Integrate** the prompt system with existing services (memory evolution, LLM)
2. **Remove** the unused system to clean up codebase
3. **Enhance** the system for future AI integration needs

## **TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS**
- System is well-architected and ready for integration
- No performance issues identified
- Thread-safe implementation
- Proper error handling and caching

## **NEXT CONVERSATION FOCUS**
User will likely want to discuss:
- Integration strategy for prompt system
- Whether to connect with memory evolution service
- Performance implications of template rendering
- Best approach: integrate, enhance, or remove

## **PROJECT STATUS**
ZetMem rebranding is 75% complete with Phase 5A-C remediation needed (build system, installation scripts, documentation). Prompts investigation is separate from rebranding completion tasks.

## **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**
Start next conversation by asking user's intent: integrate the prompt system with existing services or remove it as unused code. Then provide technical guidance based on their decision.
