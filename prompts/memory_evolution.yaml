  Analyze the following memory network and suggest evolution actions to improve organization, connections, and context quality.

  Memory Network Analysis Context:
  {{.AnalysisContext}}

  Your task is to identify patterns, redundancies, and opportunities for improvement in this memory network.
  
  Consider:
  1. Memories that should have improved context descriptions
  2. Memories that should be linked together based on:
     - Similar problem domains
     - Related technologies or frameworks
     - Solution patterns and techniques
     - Debugging contexts
     - Code progression or learning paths
  3. Tags that should be updated for better categorization
  4. Redundant or outdated information that could be consolidated

  Focus on changes that would significantly improve:
  - Discoverability of related memories
  - Context understanding
  - Knowledge organization
  - Learning progression tracking

  Respond with a JSON object in the following format:
  {
    "should_evolve": true/false,
    "actions": ["action1", "action2", ...],
    "suggested_connections": [
      {
        "target_id": "memory_id",
        "link_type": "pattern|solution|technology|debugging|progression",
        "strength": 0.8,
        "reason": "detailed reason for connection"
      }
    ],
    "context_updates": {
      "memory_id": "improved context description that better explains the coding concept or problem"
    },
    "tag_updates": {
      "memory_id": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
    },
    "metadata": {
      "analysis_summary": "brief summary of the analysis",
      "improvement_potential": "high|medium|low"
    }
  }

  Only suggest changes if they would significantly improve the memory network.
  Be conservative - quality over quantity.
