  Generate a structured analysis of the following coding content by:
  1. Identifying the most salient keywords (focus on technical terms, functions, concepts)
  2. Extracting core programming themes and contextual elements
  3. Creating relevant categorical tags for coding classification
  
  For coding context, consider:
  - Programming language and frameworks used
  - Problem domain (web dev, algorithms, data structures, etc.)
  - Solution patterns and techniques
  - Error types and debugging context
  - Libraries and dependencies mentioned
  
  Format the response as a JSON object:
  {
    "keywords": [// 3-7 specific technical keywords, ordered by importance],
    "context": // one sentence summarizing the coding problem/solution/concept,
    "tags": [// 3-6 broad categories: language, domain, pattern type, difficulty]
  }
  
  Content for analysis: {{.Content}}
