# ZetMem MCP Server Analysis - Learning Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation derived from a multi-agent analysis of the ZetMem MCP server implementation. The goal is to provide a complete template and guide for implementing MCP servers in Go.

## Documents Overview

### 1. [MCP_SERVER_GOLANG_TEMPLATE.md](./MCP_SERVER_GOLANG_TEMPLATE.md)
The main comprehensive template for building an MCP server in Go. Includes:
- Complete architecture overview
- Core server implementation with code examples
- Tool system design patterns
- Service layer architecture
- Storage and persistence patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Configuration management
- Deployment and operations guide

### 2. [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
Step-by-step implementation guide covering:
- Quick start instructions
- Project setup and structure
- Implementation patterns with examples
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security considerations
- Common pitfalls and solutions

### 3. [KEY_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md](./KEY_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md)
Documents the important architectural decisions from ZetMem:
- Transport layer choices (stdio vs HTTP/WebSocket)
- State management approach (stateless design)
- Tool interface patterns (dual interface)
- Error handling philosophy
- Configuration system design
- Storage architecture decisions
- Logging and observability strategies

### 4. [PROMPT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md](./PROMPT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md)
Complete template for implementing a prompt management system:
- Dynamic prompt loading and caching
- Template-based prompt generation
- Model-specific configurations
- Hot reloading for development
- Integration patterns with LLM services
- Testing strategies for prompts

## Analysis Methodology

This documentation was created using an 8-agent swarm analysis:

1. **Agent 1 - MCP Core Architect**: Analyzed server architecture and initialization
2. **Agent 2 - Command Structure Analyzer**: Documented command patterns and implementation
3. **Agent 3 - Prompt System Researcher**: Analyzed prompt system and tool definitions
4. **Agent 4 - Workspace Memory Specialist**: Studied workspace and memory management
5. **Agent 5 - Database Storage Analyzer**: Examined database and storage patterns
6. **Agent 6 - Error Response Reviewer**: Analyzed error handling and response patterns
7. **Agent 7 - API Interface Documenter**: Documented API patterns and tool interfaces
8. **Agent 8 - Synthesis Coordinator**: Combined all findings into comprehensive documentation

## Key Takeaways

### Architecture Principles
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Clear separation of concerns with dependency injection
- **Protocol Compliance**: Strict adherence to MCP specification
- **Stateless Operation**: No session state for scalability
- **Interface-Driven**: Enables easy testing and component substitution

### Implementation Patterns
- **Tool Registry**: Dynamic tool registration with rich metadata
- **Error Handling**: Never expose Go errors directly to protocol
- **Configuration Layers**: Defaults → YAML → Environment variables
- **Structured Logging**: Named loggers with contextual information

### Best Practices
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement graceful shutdown with context
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Design for observability from the start
- Test error scenarios thoroughly

## Usage

These documents serve as:
1. **Reference Architecture**: For designing new MCP servers
2. **Implementation Template**: Copy and adapt the code examples
3. **Learning Resource**: Understand MCP server patterns and best practices
4. **Migration Guide**: For porting MCP servers from other languages to Go

## Next Steps

To implement your own MCP server:
1. Start with the [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Use [MCP_SERVER_GOLANG_TEMPLATE.md](./MCP_SERVER_GOLANG_TEMPLATE.md) as reference
3. Review [KEY_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md](./KEY_ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md) for design choices
4. Implement prompt management using [PROMPT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md](./PROMPT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md)
